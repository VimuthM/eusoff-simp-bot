1. Implement a total 'credit/favour/whatever you want to call it' system where the user starts with certain amount of credit and uses up the credit when a request is made.

2. Implement a remark column so that users can add remarks on their requests.

3. Add 'Taken' and 'Completed' as possible statuses that a request can have.

4. Implement a time system where the user can see the name of the person, time and date a request is made. For example, 'Dabao 2 favour(s) made by Barbara at 1200 13/12/20'.

5. Implement 'take request' so a registered user can take an active request, the active request's status will change to 
   'Taken' and when the request is done, status changes to 'Completed' and credit is added to the user's total credits.

6. Implement a simp system where a user can choose to 'simp' for an active request made by the opposite gender by not taking any credits.

7. Implement a normal leaderboard and a simp leaderboard.
